lesson: 5
quizzes:
  - question: "which operator checks if two values are equal?"
    options:
      - "="
      - "=="
      - "!="
      - "<>"
    correct: 1
  - question: "what happens if all conditions in if/elif are false?"
    options:
      - "error occurs"
      - "first condition runs anyway"
      - "else block runs (if present)"
      - "program stops"
    correct: 2
  - question: "which is correct for checking if x is greater than 10?"
    options:
      - "if x > 10"
      - "if x > 10:"
      - "if (x > 10)"
      - "if x greater than 10:"
    correct: 1

# if statements

**real world analogy**: if statements are like traffic lights at an intersection. depending on the color (condition), you either stop, go, or proceed with caution. your program makes decisions the same way • it checks conditions and chooses different paths based on what it finds.

## making decisions in code

if statements give your program the power to think and make choices. just like you decide what to wear based on the weather, your program can decide what to do based on data and conditions.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("you can vote!")
else:
    print("too young to vote")
```

this code checks if someone is old enough to vote. the condition (age >= 18) is either true or false, and the program chooses the appropriate response. the colon (:) and indentation are crucial - they tell python which code belongs to each choice.

## comparison operators - asking the right questions

comparison operators let you ask specific questions about your data. they're like different types of questions you might ask when making decisions.

```python
score = 85

if score == 100:
    print("perfect score!")
elif score >= 90:
    print("excellent work!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("good job!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("passing grade")
else:
    print("needs improvement")
```

each operator asks a different question: == (exactly equal?), >= (greater than or equal?), &lt; (less than?), != (not equal?). the elif (else if) lets you check multiple conditions in order, like a decision tree.

## logical operators - combining conditions

sometimes you need to check multiple conditions at once, like "is it sunny AND warm?" or "is it raining OR snowing?". logical operators let you combine simple conditions into complex decisions.

```python
temperature = 75
is_sunny = True
has_umbrella = False

if temperature > 70 and is_sunny:
    print("perfect day for a picnic!")
elif temperature < 32 or is_raining:
    print("stay inside today")
elif not has_umbrella and is_cloudy:
    print("might want to bring an umbrella")
```

and requires both conditions to be true. or requires at least one condition to be true. not flips true to false and false to true. these operators mirror how we naturally think about complex decisions.

## real-world applications

if statements power user authentication, game logic, form validation, recommendation systems, security checks, and virtually every interactive feature in software. they're the foundation of program intelligence.

## practice challenges

1. build a simple calculator that handles division by zero
2. create a password strength checker with multiple criteria
3. design a movie recommendation system based on age and preferences
4. make a simple chatbot that responds to different user inputs

## example from class

here's a comprehensive BMI calculator that demonstrates multiple if statement concepts:

```python
# nameofperson variable which asks for name
nameofperson = input("enter your name: ")
try:
    heightW = float(input("enter your height in m(meters): "))
    weightW = float(input("enter your weight in kg(kilogram): "))
    # if the height/weight range <= or equal to 0 or weight <= 0
    if heightW <= 0 or weightW <= 0:
        print("height and weight must be positive.")
    else:
        # bmi calc logic. bmi var = the weight divided by height x height
        bmi = weightW / (heightW * heightW)
        print(f"{nameofperson}, your bmi is: {bmi:.2f}")
        # bmi classification using multiple elif statements
        if bmi < 16:
            print("classification: severe thinness")
        elif bmi < 17:
            print("classification: moderate thinness")
        elif bmi < 18.5:
            print("classification: mild thinness")
        elif bmi < 25:
            print("classification: normal")
        elif bmi < 30:
            print("classification: overweight")
        elif bmi < 35:
            print("classification: obese class I")
        elif bmi < 40:
            print("classification: obese class II")
        else:
            print("classification: obese class III")
except ValueError:
    print("invalid input")
    # exception is raised when a function receives an arg of the correct type but inappropriate val
```

**what this code demonstrates:**
- **input validation**: checks if height and weight are positive numbers
- **logical operators**: uses `or` to check multiple conditions (`heightW <= 0 or weightW <= 0`)
- **nested if statements**: the BMI classification is inside the main else block
- **multiple elif chains**: creates a decision tree for BMI categories
- **error handling**: uses try/except to handle invalid input
- **f-strings**: formats the BMI output to 2 decimal places
- **mathematical operations**: calculates BMI using the standard formula

this example shows how if statements can create complex decision-making logic that handles real-world scenarios with proper validation and user feedback.

## key concepts mastered

• if statements enable programs to make decisions based on conditions
• comparison operators (==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=) ask specific questions about data
• logical operators (and, or, not) combine multiple conditions
• else provides a default action when no conditions are met
• proper indentation is crucial for defining code blocks
• input validation prevents errors and improves user experience
