# Hello World & Print Statements

Welcome to your first Python lesson! This is the classic "Hello World" program, the first program any programmer will write when learning a new programming language.

## Your First Python Program

The `print()` function is the primary way to displaying output in Python. It's simple, powerful, and you'll use it constantly.

```py
print("Hello World")
```

When you run this code, Python's interpreter (execution engine) will display the message into the console:
```
Hello World
```

## Understanding the Print Function

The `print()` function takes what you give it and displays it on the screen. Here's what makes it useful:

### Basic Usage

```python
print("Welcome to Python!")
print("This is easy!")
```

### Printing Multiple Items

You can print multiple items at once by separating the arguments with commas:

```python
print("Python", "is", "alright")
# Output: Python is alright
```

Notice how Python automatically adds spaces between items.

### Printing Numbers

Numbers don't need quotes:

```python
print(42)
print(3.14)
```

### Mixing Text (strings) and Numbers

You can combine strings and numbers in a single print statement:

```python
print("The answer is", 42)
# Output: The answer is 42
```

## Special Characters

Python supports special characters in strings:

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")  # \n creates a new line
print("Tab\there")     # \t creates a tab
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Forgetting Quotes:**
```python
print(Hello)  # ❌ Error! Python thinks Hello is a variable
print("Hello")  # ✅ Correct!
```

**Mismatched Quotes:**
```python
print("Hello')  # ❌ Error! Quotes don't match
print("Hello")  # ✅ Correct!
```

## Practice Makes Perfect

Try these exercises on your own:

- Print your name
- Print your age
- Print a fun fact about yourself
- Print multiple items on one line

## Key Points

- `print()` displays output to the console
- Strings (text) need quotes: `"text"` or `'text'`
- Numbers don't need quotes
- Separate multiple items with commas
- Python adds spaces automatically between comma-separated items

Now that you know how to output information, you're ready to move forward! Remember, even the most complex programs use `print()` for debugging and displaying results.
