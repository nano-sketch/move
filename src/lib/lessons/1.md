# Hello World & Print Statements

The "Hello World" program, a program that every programmer has written at least once when they started. It teaches us the core fundamentals of a programming language - and that is the syntax it's built upon. Think of a print statement as a way for the program to talk to the user, or in most cases the programmer. It allows the user to know what is going in inside the programs logic, for example; it could print the sum of two numbers, or an inspirational quote.

But why is it important? It's important because it gets you used to the concept of calling functions and understanding the structure of a program, which is crucial for debugging errors or reading other peoples code in the future. But let's go and take a look about what I'm talking about:

## The function
```python
print("hello, world!")
```

Looks very simple right? Because it is, all we're doing is calling the `print` function and passing an `argument` in it, that argument being a `string`. Think of a `string` as nothing but text, or more specifically - a sequence of characters (bytes).

## More on print

The `print` function can do a lot more than just print text, it can print numeric literals (numbers), lists, arrays, or any object. You can also combine these objects together with the `,` character after an object, you can also concatenate (add) `strings` together.

```python
print("hey dude")           # Print a string
print(42)                   # Print an integer
print(3.14159)              # Print a float
print("2 + 2 =", 4)         # Print a string and an integer
print("hello " + "world")   # Print a concatenated string
```

## Escape sequences

An escape sequence can be used in a string, it's essentially a combination of two characters which have a meaning. For example `\n` is an escape sequence, and it's meaning is to emplace a new line into the string at that location. This is awesome for formatting blocks of text in your own way to make it more clear what you're displaying. `\\` allows you to insert a `\` (backslash) into a string. There are loads more but you don't need to worry about them, you can read about them at [Python Escape Sequences](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences)

```python
print("line one\nline two") # \n creates a new line
print("name:\tjohn") # \t creates a tab space
print("she said, \"hello there!\"") # \" puts quotes inside text
```

## Practice Challenges
Go back and read everything again, and practice these challenges:

1. Print a welcome message with your name.
2. Display your age and favorite hobby on one line.
3. Create a simple receipt showing the items and it's price.
4. Print a haiku with multiple lines using `\n`

## Key Concepts

1. `print` is Python's way of displaying information.
2. Text (strings) must be wrapped in quotes (as usual).
3. Constants (numeric literals) do not need to be wrapped within quotes.
4. Commas separate multiple items (arguments) and add spaces.
5. Escape sequences like \n and \t control formatting.
6. `print` is essential for debugging and user interaction.
