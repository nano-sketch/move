# built-in functions

**real world analogy**: built in functions are like the tools in a well equipped kitchen. just as you have a can opener, measuring cups, and a timer ready to use, python provides essential functions like input(), len(), and max() that are always available when you need them.

## understanding built-in functions

built-in functions are python's gift to programmers - pre-written tools that handle common tasks. instead of writing complex code from scratch, you can use these functions to get input, calculate values, and process data efficiently.

## getting user input

input() is like having a conversation with your program. it pauses execution and waits for the user to type something, then returns whatever they entered as text.

```python
# get user's name
name = input("what's your name? ")
# get user's age
age = input("how old are you? ")
# display personalized message
print(f"hello {name}, you are {age} years old!")
```

input() always returns a string, even if the user types numbers. this is important to remember when you need to do calculations with the input.

## converting between data types

type conversion functions transform data from one type to another. they're like translators that help different parts of your program communicate.

```python
# get age as text from user
age_text = input("enter your age: ")
# convert text to whole number
age_number = int(age_text)

# text containing decimal number
height_text = "5.8"
# convert to decimal number
height_number = float(height_text)

# number we want to convert
score = 95
# convert number to text
score_text = str(score)

# convert number to true/false
is_valid = bool(age_number)
```

int() converts to whole numbers, float() converts to decimal numbers, str() converts to text, and bool() converts to true/false values. these functions are essential for working with user input and data processing.

## mathematical functions

python provides powerful mathematical functions that handle complex calculations instantly.

```python
numbers = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 56]

total = sum(numbers)
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
highest = max(numbers)
lowest = min(numbers)
count = len(numbers)

print(f"total: {total}")
print(f"average: {average:.2f}")
print(f"highest: {highest}")
print(f"lowest: {lowest}")
print(f"count: {count}")
```

sum() adds all numbers in a collection, max() finds the largest value, min() finds the smallest, and len() counts how many items are in a collection. these functions work with lists, tuples, and other data structures.

## real-world applications

built-in functions power form validation, data processing, user interfaces, calculations, text analysis, and virtually every interactive program. they're the building blocks of professional software.

## practice challenges

1. create a grade calculator that validates input and computes statistics
2. build a simple survey program that collects and analyzes responses
3. make a number guessing game with input validation and hints
4. design a text analyzer that counts words, characters, and sentences

## example from class

here's a user authentication system that demonstrates multiple built-in functions working together:

```python
def CreateUserDb():  # the database function which stores usernames and functions inside the users dictionary
    users = {
        "yasin123": "Passwordok",
        "Idk": "passwordok", 
        "IDk2": "hey",
        "Idk3": "idkutellme",
        "Idk4": "something"
    }
    return users
 
def AuthUser():
    UserDb = CreateUserDb()
    MaxAttempt = 3  # max attempts which are three
    CurrAttempt = 0   # starts from zero for current attempt
    while CurrAttempt < MaxAttempt:
        username = input("enter username: ").strip()  # strip removes whitespaces from any input so for example if the user pastes something that has an invisible whitespace it removes it.
        password = input("enter password: ").strip()
        if username in UserDb and UserDb[username] == password:  # if the username is in the UserDb function (it checks for the usernames inside the dictionary and if they have the correct pass it will print login successful)
            print("login successful!")
            print(f"welcome, {username}!")
            return True
        else:
            CurrAttempt += 1  # it increments by one
            remaining = MaxAttempt - CurrAttempt  # max attempt minuses the current attempt until 3 attempts are over.
            if remaining > 0:
                print(f"invalid credentials. {remaining} attempts remaining.")
            else:
                print("maximum attempts reached. access denied.")
                return False
    return False
     
# prints authentication required at the top.
print("authentication required")
if AuthUser():
    print("access granted")  # if user is authenticated it grants access with a print message.
    print()
else:
    print("denied/exit")
    exit()
```

**what this code demonstrates:**
- **input() function**: gets username and password from user
- **strip() method**: removes whitespace from input to prevent errors
- **print() function**: displays messages and feedback to user
- **len() concept**: tracks attempt counts and remaining attempts
- **bool() logic**: functions return True/False for authentication status
- **string operations**: compares usernames and passwords
- **exit() function**: terminates program when access is denied
- **f-strings**: formats welcome messages with usernames

this example shows how built-in functions work together to create a complete authentication system with input validation, attempt tracking, and user feedback.

## calculator example from class

here's a calculator program that demonstrates custom functions working with built-in functions:

```python
# calculator with menu that asks for input and does calculations based on user input

num1 = float(input("enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("enter second number: "))

# adding function
def add(num1, num2):
    resultf = num1 + num2
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {resultf}")
    return resultf

# subtracting function
def subtract(num1, num2):
    resultf = num1 - num2
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {resultf}")
    return resultf

# multiplying function
def multiply(num1, num2):
    resultf = num1 * num2
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {resultf}")
    return resultf

# dividing function
def divide(num1, num2):
    if num2 == 0:
        print("cannot / by 0")
        return None  # return none if second num is 0
    resultf = num1 / num2
    print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {resultf}")
    return resultf

# save calculations to text file in the same directory as the script.
def SaveCalc(calculation):
    with open("calculations.txt", "a") as f:
        f.write(calculation + "\n")  # writes with new line after each calculation

# the main function that displays the menu and calls the appropriate function based on user input.
def main():
    print(" --- select operation --- ")
    choice = input("enter the choice(1add/2subtract/3multiply/4divide): ")
    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
        if choice == '1':
            resultf = add(num1, num2)
            if resultf is not None:
                SaveCalc(f"{resultf}")
        elif choice == '2':
            resultf = subtract(num1, num2)
            if resultf is not None:
                SaveCalc(f"{resultf}")
        elif choice == '3':
            resultf = multiply(num1, num2)
            if resultf is not None:
                SaveCalc(f"{resultf}")
        elif choice == '4':
            resultf = divide(num1, num2)
            if resultf is not None:
                SaveCalc(f"{resultf}")
    else:
        print("invalid")

if __name__ == "__main__":  # this is the entry point of the program if the script is run directly not when imported as a module.
    main()  # it calls the main function
```

**what this code demonstrates:**
- **input() and float()**: gets numbers from user and converts to decimal
- **custom functions**: creates reusable calculation functions
- **print() with f-strings**: displays formatted calculation results
- **return values**: functions return results for further processing
- **file operations**: saves calculations to text file using open()
- **conditional logic**: uses if/elif to handle different operations
- **error handling**: checks for division by zero
- **main function pattern**: organizes code with entry point

this example shows how built-in functions like input(), float(), print(), and open() work together with custom functions to create a complete calculator application.
