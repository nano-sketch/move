# Lists

Lists are one of Python's most versatile data structures. They're ordered collections that can hold any type of data and can be modified after creation.

## What is a List?

A list is an ordered collection of items. Think of it as a container that holds multiple values in a specific order.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
```

## Creating Lists

```python
empty = []
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
numbers = list(range(5))
evens = list(range(0, 10, 2))
print(numbers)
print(evens)
```

## Accessing Elements

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[-1])

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:4])
print(numbers[::2])
print(numbers[::-1])
```

## Modifying Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits[1] = "grape"
print(fruits)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[1:3] = [20, 30]
print(numbers)
```

## Adding Elements

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.append("orange")
fruits.insert(1, "grape")
print(fruits)

list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
```

## Removing Elements

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
del fruits[1]
print(fruits)

last = fruits.pop()
print(last)
```

## List Methods

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2]
print(numbers.count(2))
print(numbers.index(3))

numbers.sort()
print(numbers)

numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)

copy = numbers.copy()
print(copy)
```

## Checking Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "banana" in fruits:
    print("Found banana")
print(len(fruits))
```

## Looping Through Lists

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
```

## List Comprehension

Create lists using compact syntax:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)

words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
upper = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper)
```

## Nested Lists

Lists can contain other lists:

```python
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

print(matrix[0][0])
print(matrix[1][2])

for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item, end=" ")
    print()
```

## Common Operations

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(sum(numbers))
print(min(numbers))
print(max(numbers))

words = ["Hello", "World"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)
```

## Unpacking Lists

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
a, b, c = numbers
print(a, b, c)

first, *rest = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(first)
print(rest)

*start, last = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(start)
print(last)
```

## Sorting

### Sort Function

```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
sorted_nums = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_nums)
print(numbers)
```

### Custom Sorting

```python
words = ["banana", "pie", "Washington", "book"]
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)
print(sorted_words)
```

## Common Patterns

### Filter List

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)
```

### Map List

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = [x * 2 for x in numbers]
print(doubled)
```

### Remove Duplicates

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
unique = list(set(numbers))
print(unique)
```

### Flatten Nested List

```python
nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
flat = [item for sublist in nested for item in sublist]
print(flat)
```

## Common Mistakes

**Index out of range:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]
print(fruits[5])
```

**Modifying while iterating:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    numbers.remove(num)
```

**Shallow copy issue:**
```python
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
copy = original
copy[0][0] = 99
print(original)
```

## Practice Challenges

Try these exercises:

1. Create a list of your favorite foods
2. Add a new food to the list
3. Remove a food you don't like anymore
4. Print each food with its position
5. Create a list of numbers and find their sum

## Key Points

- Lists are ordered and mutable collections
- Index starts at 0, negative indices count from end
- Use `append()` to add items, `remove()` to delete
- Slicing syntax: `list[start:end:step]`
- List comprehension for compact list creation
- Methods: `sort()`, `reverse()`, `count()`, `index()`
- Use `in` to check membership
- Lists can contain any data type, including other lists

Lists are fundamental to Python programming and you'll use them constantly in real-world applications.
