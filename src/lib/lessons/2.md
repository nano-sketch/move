# Variables & Data Types

Variables are containers that store data. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information and use them later.
A more in depth explanation of variables: variables are a label which points to a specific part of memory which holds the data it's bound to.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is a name that refers to a value. Instead of typing the same value repeatedly, you store it once and reference it by name. This reduces the amount of times you'd need to repeat a common value which will be used in your program, such as the `age` of a person, or the `name` of a city.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(name)  # Output: Alice
print(age)   # Output: 25
```

## Variable Naming Rules

Python has specific rules for naming variables:

**Valid names:**
```python
user_name = "Bob"
age2 = 30
_private = "hidden"
firstName = "John"
```

**Invalid names:**
```python
2nd_place = "Silver"  # ❌ Can't start with a number
my-variable = 5       # ❌ Can't use hyphens
my variable = 10      # ❌ Can't have spaces
class = "Math"        # ❌ Can't use Python keywords
```

**Best practices:**
- Use descriptive names: `user_age` not `ua`
- Use lowercase with underscores: `first_name` (snake_case)
- Avoid single letters except for simple counters: `i`, `x`, `y`

## Core Data Types

Python has several built-in data types. Let's explore the most important ones:

### Integers (int)

Whole numbers without decimal points:

```python
age = 25
temperature = -5
year = 2025
```

### Floats (float)

Numbers with decimal points:

```python
price = 19.99
temperature = 98.6
pi = 3.14159
```

### Strings (str)

Text enclosed in quotes:

```python
name = "Alice"
message = 'Hello World'
multiline = """This is
a multiline
string"""
```

You can use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes interchangeably!

### Booleans (bool)

True or False values (note the capital letters):

```python
is_logged_in = True
is_valid = False
has_permission = True
```

## Working with Variables

### Assignment

Use the equals sign (`=`) to assign values:

```python
x = 10
name = "Python"
is_active = True
```

### Reassignment

Variables can be changed:

```python
score = 0
print(score)  # Output: 0

score = 100
print(score)  # Output: 100
```

### Multiple Assignment

Assign multiple variables at once:

```python
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
name, age = "Alice", 25

# Same value to multiple variables
a = b = c = 0
```

## Checking Data Types

Use the `type()` function to see what type a variable is:

```python
age = 25
print(type(age))  # Output:

price = 19.99
print(type(price))  # Output:

name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # Output:

is_valid = True
print(type(is_valid))  # Output:
```

## Type Conversion

Convert between types using built-in functions:

```python
# String to integer
age = "25"
age_number = int(age)  # 25

# Integer to string
score = 100
score_text = str(score)  # "100"

# String to float
price = "19.99"
price_number = float(price)  # 19.99

# Integer to float
value = 10
value_float = float(value)  # 10.0
```

## Basic Operations with Variables

### Numbers

```python
x = 10
y = 3

print(x + y)  # Addition: 13
print(x - y)  # Subtraction: 7
print(x * y)  # Multiplication: 30
print(x / y)  # Division: 3.333...
print(x // y) # Integer division: 3
print(x % y)  # Modulo (remainder): 1
print(x ** y) # Exponentiation: 1000
```

### Strings

```python
first = "Hello"
last = "World"
full = first + " " + last
print(full)  # Output: Hello World

# Repetition
laugh = "ha" * 3
print(laugh)  # Output: hahaha
```

## Common Mistakes

**Using undefined variables:**
```python
print(username)  # ❌ Error if username wasn't defined first
```

**Type mismatches:**
```python
age = "25"
next_year = age + 1  # ❌ Error: can't add string and integer
```

**Correct version:**
```python
age = "25"
next_year = int(age) + 1  # ✅ Convert to int first
print(next_year)  # Output: 26
```

## Practice Challenges

Try creating these variables:

1. Your name as a string
2. Your age as an integer
3. Your height in meters as a float
4. Whether you're a student as a boolean

Then try:
- Print each variable with a descriptive message
- Change one variable and print it again
- Convert your age to a string and print it

## Key Points

- Variables store data for later use
- Use descriptive, lowercase names with underscores
- Main data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
- Use `type()` to check a variable's type
- Convert between types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Variables can be reassigned anytime
- Python is dynamically typed (types can change)

Understanding variables and data types is fundamental to everything you'll do in Python.
