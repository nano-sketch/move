# variables & data types

**real world analogy**: variables are like labeled storage boxes in your room. each box has a name written on it (the variable name) and contains something specific inside (the data). just like you might have a box labeled "photos" containing your pictures, variables have names and contain different types of information.

## understanding variables

variables are python's way of remembering information. imagine your brain storing facts • "my name is alice", "i am 25 years old". variables work the same way, storing information your program can use later.

```python
# store text in a variable
name = "alice"
# store whole number
age = 25
# store decimal number
height = 5.6
# store true/false value
is_student = True
```

each line creates a labeled container. the equals sign doesn't mean "equal to" • it means "store this value in this container." think of it as putting a label on a box and filling it with something specific.

## the four fundamental data types

python organizes information into four main categories, like sorting items in your house into different types of containers.

### strings • storing text information
strings are like writing on paper • they hold any text you want to remember. they're always wrapped in quotes to tell python "this is text, not a command."

```python
# store a name as text
first_name = "john"
# store a longer sentence
favorite_quote = "python makes programming fun"
# store empty text
empty_message = ""
```

strings can hold letters, numbers, symbols, and even be completely empty. the quotes act like quotation marks in writing - they show where the text begins and ends.

### integers - whole numbers only
integers are like counting objects - they're always whole numbers with no decimal points. perfect for counting things, ages, or years.

```python
# count of students (whole number)
student_count = 30
# year someone was born
birth_year = 1999
# temperature can be negative
temperature = -5
```

integers can be positive, negative, or zero. they're ideal when you need exact counts or when decimal places don't make sense (like "2.5 students").

### floats - numbers with decimal precision
floats are like measuring with a ruler - they can have decimal places for precise measurements. essential for calculations involving money, measurements, or scientific data.

```python
# person's height with decimal
height = 5.75
# price with cents
price = 19.99
# mathematical constant
pi = 3.14159
```

floats handle any number that needs decimal precision. they're crucial for real-world calculations where exact measurements matter.

### booleans - true or false decisions
booleans are like light switches - they're either on (true) or off (false). they represent yes/no decisions and conditions in your program.

```python
# weather condition (true/false)
is_sunny = True
# homework status
has_homework = False
# food preference
likes_pizza = True
```

booleans are perfect for storing the answer to yes/no questions. they help your program make decisions based on conditions.

## variable naming best practices

naming variables is like labeling boxes clearly • good names make your code readable and professional. follow these rules to write clean, understandable code.

```python
# descriptive variable names
user_name = "alice"
total_score = 95
is_game_over = False
player_health = 100
```

good variable names describe what they contain. avoid abbreviations and use underscores to separate words. this makes your code read like english sentences.

## checking what type of data you have

sometimes you need to verify what type of information a variable contains. python's type() function is like asking "what's in this box?"

```python
# create variables of different types
name = "alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

# check what type each variable is
print(type(name))        # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))         # <class 'int'>
print(type(height))      # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student))  # <class 'bool'>
```

this shows you exactly what type of data each variable holds. it's incredibly useful for debugging and understanding your program's behavior.

## real-world applications

variables are the foundation of every program. they store user information in social media apps, track scores in games, manage inventory in online stores, and hold sensor data in smart home systems.

## practice challenges

1. create variables for a person's complete profile (name, age, height, is_employed)
2. store information about your favorite book (title, author, pages, is_fiction)
3. make variables for a simple calculator (first_number, second_number, operation)
4. create a weather report using all four data types

## key concepts mastered

• variables are labeled containers that store information
• strings hold text and need quotes
• integers store whole numbers without decimals
• floats handle numbers with decimal precision
• booleans represent true/false conditions
• good variable names make code readable and professional
• type() reveals what kind of data a variable contains
