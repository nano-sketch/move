# flowcharts

**real world analogy**: flowcharts are like GPS navigation for your code. just as GPS shows you the route from point A to point B with decision points ("turn left if road is clear"), flowcharts map out your program's logic with clear steps and decision points.

## understanding flowcharts

flowcharts are visual diagrams that represent the flow of a program or algorithm. they use standardized shapes to show different types of operations and arrows to show the sequence of steps. think of them as blueprints for your code - they help you plan before you build.

## the 5 essential flowchart shapes

### 1. terminator (oval/circle)
![Terminator Shape](/flowchartsets/terminator.png)

**purpose**: marks the beginning and end of your flowchart
**when to use**: every flowchart must start and end with this shape
**examples**: "START", "END", "STOP"

the terminator is like the front door and back door of your house - every program needs an entry point and an exit point.

### 2. process (rectangle)
![Process Shape](/flowchartsets/rectangle.png)

**purpose**: represents any action, calculation, or operation
**when to use**: for any step that does something or processes data
**examples**: "calculate total", "print message", "add 1 to counter"

process boxes are the workhorses of your flowchart - they represent the actual "doing" parts of your program.

### 3. decision (diamond)
![Decision Shape](/flowchartsets/diamond.png)

**purpose**: represents a yes/no question or condition
**when to use**: when your program needs to make a choice
**examples**: "is age > 18?", "is password correct?", "continue loop?"

decision diamonds are like crossroads - they determine which path your program takes based on conditions.

### 4. data (parallelogram)
![Data Shape](/flowchartsets/parallelogram.png)

**purpose**: represents input from user or output to user
**when to use**: when getting data from user or displaying results
**examples**: "INPUT username", "OUTPUT total", "DISPLAY message"

data shapes are like the communication bridges between your program and the outside world.

### 5. connector (small circle)
![Connector Shape](/flowchartsets/connector.png)

**purpose**: connects different parts of the flowchart
**when to use**: to avoid crossing lines or connect distant parts
**examples**: labeled with letters (A, B, C) or numbers (1, 2, 3)

connectors are like teleportation points - they help keep your flowchart clean by connecting distant parts without messy crossing lines.

## how flowcharts connect

flowcharts use **arrows** to show the flow of execution. the arrows tell you which step comes next, creating a clear path through your logic.

### basic flow rules:
1. **start at the top**: always begin with a terminator marked "START"
2. **follow the arrows**: arrows show the sequence of steps
3. **one entry, one exit**: each shape should have one way in and one way out (except decisions)
4. **decisions have two exits**: labeled "yes/no" or "true/false"
5. **end at the bottom**: finish with a terminator marked "END"

## example: simple login flowchart

**flowchart steps:**
1. **START** (terminator - oval)
2. **INPUT username** (data - parallelogram)
3. **INPUT password** (data - parallelogram)  
4. **valid login?** (decision - diamond)
   - if **yes** → **show welcome message** (process - rectangle) → **END**
   - if **no** → **show error message** (process - rectangle) → **END**
5. **END** (terminator - oval)

**visual flowchart:**
![Example Flowchart](/flowchartg.png)

this flowchart example shows:
- **start/end ovals** - clearly marked beginning and ending points
- **process rectangles** - showing actions and operations being performed
- **decision diamonds** - with yes/no or true/false branching paths
- **connecting arrows** - showing the logical flow between steps
- **proper labeling** - each shape contains clear, descriptive text

*this is a clear and basic flowchart that shows the flow of a program, its easy to understand and follow and can easily be translated into programming code.*






## why flowcharts matter

flowcharts are essential for:
- **planning**: think through your logic before coding
- **communication**: share ideas with team members
- **debugging**: visualize where problems might occur
- **documentation**: create clear records of your algorithms
- **btec coursework**: required for many computing assignments

remember: a good flowchart is like a good map - it shows you exactly where you're going and how to get there, making your coding journey much smoother and more successful.
