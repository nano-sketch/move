# While Loops

While loops allow you to repeat code as long as a condition is true. They're perfect when you don't know exactly how many times you need to loop.

## Basic While Loop

The simplest form of a while loop checks a condition and runs the code block repeatedly until the condition becomes false:

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

## How While Loops Work

1. Check the condition
2. If true, execute the code block
3. Repeat from step 1
4. If false, exit the loop

```python
x = 1
while x <= 3:
    print("Loop iteration:", x)
    x += 1
print("Loop finished")
```

## Common Patterns

### Counting Up

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

### Counting Down

```python
countdown = 5
while countdown > 0:
    print(countdown)
    countdown -= 1
print("Blast off!")
```

### User Input Loop

```python
password = ""
while password != "secret":
    password = input("Enter password: ")
print("Access granted")
```

## Break Statement

Use `break` to exit a loop early:

```python
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
```

## Continue Statement

Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration:

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 3:
        continue
    print(x)
```

Output:
```
1
2
4
5
```

## While-Else

Python allows an `else` clause that runs when the loop completes normally:

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed")
```

## Infinite Loops

Be careful! If the condition never becomes false, the loop runs forever:

```python
while True:
    print("This runs forever!")
```

Always ensure your loop has a way to exit:

```python
running = True
while running:
    user_input = input("Type 'quit' to exit: ")
    if user_input == "quit":
        running = False
```

## Nested While Loops

You can put while loops inside other while loops:

```python
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 2:
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
        j += 1
    i += 1
```

## Common Mistakes

**Forgetting to update the condition:**
```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    print(x)
```

**Off-by-one errors:**
```python
count = 1
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

**Modifying loop variable incorrectly:**
```python
x = 10
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 2
```

## Practice Challenges

Try these exercises:

1. Print numbers from 1 to 10
2. Print even numbers from 0 to 20
3. Create a countdown from 10 to 1
4. Sum numbers from 1 to 100
5. Keep asking for input until user types "stop"

## Key Points

- While loops repeat code while a condition is true
- Always update the condition variable inside the loop
- Use `break` to exit early
- Use `continue` to skip iterations
- Watch out for infinite loops
- The condition is checked before each iteration

While loops are essential for situations where you need to repeat actions but don't know the exact number of iterations in advance.
