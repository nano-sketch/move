# Syntax

> Syntax - a set of rules that dictate how code is structured and formatted in a programming language.

Syntax of a programming language governs how the programmer should write code within that language, such as validity of a certain expression - but let's go into more depth.

In Python, your program consists of statements, statements are lines of code that instructs the computer to perform a specific action, like we covered in the lessons before; variable declarations `name = "john"` are statements, same as assigning variables `name = "bob"`, and function calls `print("hi")`.

Additionally, statements are built upon `expressions`, this is a core fundamental of the syntax of a language. An `expression` can refer to multiple things in a language, in Python an expression can look like this: `name`, this is a reference to a variable (an expression), another expression can be any arithmetic operations: `2 + 2`, this is an expression.

## understanding loops

loops are python's way of avoiding repetitive work. instead of writing the same code 100 times, you write it once and tell python to repeat it. it's like having a personal assistant who follows the same instructions over and over.

## for loops - when you know how many times

for loops are like following a recipe that says "stir 10 times" - you know exactly how many repetitions you need. they're perfect when you have a specific count in mind.

```python
# loop from 1 to 5 (6 is not included)
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"step {i} completed")
```

this loop runs exactly 5 times, printing each step number. the variable 'i' acts like a counter, automatically increasing from 1 to 5. it's like having a built-in timer that tracks your progress.

## mastering the range function

range() is like a number generator that creates sequences for your loops. it's incredibly flexible and can count in any pattern you need.

```python
# range(5) means 0 to 4
for i in range(5):
    print(f"counting: {i}")

# range(2, 8) means 2 to 7
for i in range(2, 8):
    print(f"from 2 to 7: {i}")

# range(0, 20, 3) means 0 to 19, step by 3
for i in range(0, 20, 3):
    print(f"every 3rd number: {i}")
```

the first example counts from 0 to 4 (5 total numbers). the second counts from 2 to 7. the third counts by threes: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18. range() gives you complete control over your counting pattern.

## while loops - when you don't know how many times

while loops are like waiting for a bus - you keep checking until it arrives, but you don't know exactly when. they repeat as long as a condition stays true.

```python
# start with empty password
password = ""
# keep looping until correct password
while password != "secret123":
    if password != "secret123":
        print("incorrect, try again")
print("access granted!")
break is like pulling the emergency brake on a train - it immediately stops the loop no matter what.

```python
for i in range(100):
    if i == 7:
        print("found lucky number 7!")
        break
    print(f"checking number {i}")
```

this loop would normally run 100 times, but when it reaches 7, break stops everything immediately. it's perfect for finding something specific or handling emergency conditions.

### continue - skip this round
continue is like skipping a song on your playlist - it jumps to the next iteration without finishing the current one.

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(f"odd number: {i}")
```

this loop skips all even numbers and only prints odd ones. when continue runs, it jumps straight to the next iteration without executing the remaining code in the loop.

## practical loop patterns

these patterns solve common programming problems and appear in professional code everywhere.

### building a countdown timer
```python
for seconds in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"launching in {seconds} seconds...")
    time.sleep(1)
print("blast off!")
```

this creates a dramatic countdown by counting backwards from 10 to 1. the negative step (-1) makes range() count in reverse.

### calculating totals and averages
```python
total = 0
count = 0
for score in [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]:
    total += score
    count += 1
average = total / count
print(f"average score: {average}")
```

this pattern accumulates values in a total variable while counting how many items you've processed. it's essential for statistics and data analysis.

## real-world applications

loops power everything from video game engines (game loop) to web servers (processing requests) to data analysis (processing thousands of records). they're the heartbeat of most programs.

## practice challenges

1. create a multiplication table for any number
2. build a simple guessing game that continues until correct
3. calculate the factorial of a number using a loop
4. print a pattern of stars forming a triangle

## example from class

here's a number comparison program that demonstrates for loops with conditional logic:

```python
firstNum = int(input("enter first number: "))
# firstNum variable which asks for input(enter first number)

# the second variable does the same(asks for second number)
secondNum = int(input("enter second number: "))

if firstNum == secondNum:
    print("numbers are equal")
    # if both numbers are the same it says both numbers are equal

elif firstNum < secondNum:  # elif (decision)
    for i in range(firstNum, secondNum + 1):
        print(i, end=" ")

else:
    for i in range(firstNum, secondNum - 1, -1):
        print(i, end=" ")
```

**what this code demonstrates:**
- **for loops with range()**: uses range() to create number sequences
- **conditional loops**: different loop behavior based on if/elif/else conditions
- **ascending range**: `range(firstNum, secondNum + 1)` counts up from first to second number
- **descending range**: `range(firstNum, secondNum - 1, -1)` counts down using negative step
- **print formatting**: `end=" "` prints numbers on same line separated by spaces
- **input conversion**: `int(input())` converts string input to integers
- **comparison logic**: checks if numbers are equal, less than, or greater than

this example shows how loops can be combined with conditional statements to create different behaviors based on user input. the program intelligently counts up or down depending on which number is larger.

## key concepts mastered

• for loops repeat a specific number of times
• while loops repeat while a condition is true
• range() generates number sequences with start, stop, and step
• break exits a loop immediately
• continue skips to the next iteration
• loops are essential for processing data and automating repetitive tasks
• proper loop control prevents infinite loops and improves efficiency
